# Project for the course DS 5220 Supervised Machine learning
### Spotify Track Popularity Prediction

Abstract:

In todayâ€™s increasingly data-driven world, if Spotify can quantify music using this data, they can
generate more revenue for themselves and provide a better experience to their users. This
project aims to compare ensemble learning algorithms (XGBoost, Categorical Boosting, Light
Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Random Forest) and observe if improved predictions are being
made on the data in order to see which one most effectively predicts the popularity of a song
and what auditory features contribute to this popularity. The highest accuracies are given by
the AdaBoost and Random Forest classifiers, with 0.9111 and 0.9113 respectively.
